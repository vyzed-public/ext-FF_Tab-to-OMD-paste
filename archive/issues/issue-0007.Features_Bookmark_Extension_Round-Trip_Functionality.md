After some use of the bookmarking extention ecosystem, we realized we need to deal with this problem:

> Let's look at these results from one cycle.

> 1) We used `Tab-to-OMD` to collect to three or four different bookmarks.

> 2) Then we used `OMD-to-BMM` to paste them into Firefox bookmark manager.

> 3) Then we used `BMM-to-OMD` to base them into Obsidian again.

> Observe that the formats have changed.

> Understand that we don't want that.

...which, after a bunch of extraneous chat & experiments, we concluded:

> The chain of authority should be:

> 1) `OMD-to-BMM` — works correctly, respects Firefox BMM structure, (especially separators), so don't touch it

> 2) `Tab-to-OMD` — defines the canonical format (bullet + em-dash + 2-space indent)

> 3) `BMM-to-OMD` — should be updated to output that same canonical format

> So when `BMM-to-OMD` exports from Firefox back to Obsidian, instead of outputting 4-space indented child bullets for links, it should output 2-space indented em-dashes. That way the round-trip is format-stable.

...so -- we packaged our findings into this spec doc:

### Spec: [spec.04a.bookmark-round-trip-format.md](https://github.com/vyzed-public/ext-FF_Tab-to-OMD-paste/blob/main/specs/spec.04a.bookmark-round-trip-format.md)

### And then...

We made the mistake of not checking which model Claude was giving us and ended up using fucking Sonnet, 

...which is pertty brain damage compared to Opus.

But, FWIW, here is the archived chat:
