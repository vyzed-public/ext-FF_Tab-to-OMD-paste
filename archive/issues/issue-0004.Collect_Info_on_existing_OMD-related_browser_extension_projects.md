Searches found two existing related projects to use as benchmarks:
- One is a published Firefox add-on (by [rom100main](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13464738/))
  - Firefox add-on: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/obsidian-bookmark/
  - Project Repo: https://github.com/rom100main/Obsidian-Bookmarks-Browser-Extension
- One is a not-yet-published GitHub repo (by Patrik Zúdel)
  - GitHub repo: https://github.com/patrikzudel/firefox-obsidian-bookmark

Note that the projects have **very similar names and descriptions**, which is why search results may conflated them. 

Especially because they both solve the exact same Firefox→Obsidian bookmark workflow

### Query:

```
Is it possible to reverse engineer the mozilla add-on after installation, and create a repo that would let us see and extend the source code?
```

### Response 

**Yes**, it is straightforward to reverse engineer a Firefox add-on after installation by extracting its XPI file, which is just a ZIP archive containing the source code. Firefox extensions are distributed as `.xpi` files that can be unpacked to reveal JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and `manifest.json` — no special tools needed beyond a ZIP extractor. [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Extract-Firefox-Addon-Source-Code/)

## Exact steps
1. **Download the XPI**: Go to the add-on page (`https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/obsidian-bookmark/`), right-click the **"Add to Firefox"** button, and **Save Link As** → save the `.xpi` file. [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/11lghex/how_to_check_the_source_code_of_an_extension/)
2. **Rename to ZIP**: Change the file extension from `.xpi` to `.zip`. [[instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Extract-Firefox-Addon-Source-Code/)](https://www.instructables.com/Extract-Firefox-Addon-Source-Code/)
3. **Extract**: Use any ZIP tool (7-Zip, Windows Explorer, etc.) to unpack the contents. [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Extract-Firefox-Addon-Source-Code/)
4. **Explore**: Open the extracted folder — you’ll see `manifest.json`, JavaScript files, and other source code. [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6788803/reverse-engineering-a-firefox-extension)

## To create a repo
1. Extract the XPI as above.
2. Create a new GitHub repo.
3. Upload all the extracted files (respect the original folder structure).
4. Optionally, edit `manifest.json` and other files to customize/extend it.

## To test modifications
1. Make changes to the extracted source.
2. Zip the folder back up (rename to `.xpi`).
3. In Firefox, go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` → **Load Temporary Add-on** → select your modified `.xpi`. [[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhaGRJvJAII)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhaGRJvJAII)

## Important notes
- **Legal**: Respect the author’s license. Many extensions are open-source or permissive, but check `LICENSE` or `manifest.json` for terms. Reverse engineering for personal use/extension is generally fine; redistribution may require permission. [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6788803/reverse-engineering-a-firefox-extension)
- **No obfuscation**: Firefox extensions ship as readable source code, not compiled/minified binaries. [[instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Extract-Firefox-Addon-Source-Code/)](https://www.instructables.com/Extract-Firefox-Addon-Source-Code/)
- **Temporary**: Modified versions loaded via `about:debugging` don’t persist across restarts. [[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhaGRJvJAII)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhaGRJvJAII)

This workflow works for **any Firefox extension** — the Obsidian bookmark one will unpack cleanly. [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/11lghex/how_to_check_the_source_code_of_an_extension/)
